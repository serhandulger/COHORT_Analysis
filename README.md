# WHAT IS COHORT ANALYSIS AND ITS ADVANTAGES ?
###################################################

COHORT analysis is useful in identifying loyal customers and makes it easier for you to learn about the common characteristics of people in your target audience. In addition, makes it easier for companies to measure some of their studies.

•	Cohort analysis provides a better understanding of user trends and behaviours of cohorts  that affect business metrics like acquisitions and retention.

•	A better understanding of user trends and behaviors allows you to take steps to encourage other users to follow the same behaviors you identified in other cohorts.

•	Cohort Analyses ensure more effective customer engagement that leads to optimized conversion rates. Cross-selling opportunities arise when you understand customer interaction towards marketing strategies and towards certain aspects of your product or service.
